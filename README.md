## 🧬 Infectious Disease Text Annotation and NER-POS Tagging with BiLSTM-CRF
## 📘 Overview

This project is part of my undergraduate thesis focused on annotating infectious disease texts to support structured data extraction and linguistic analysis.
The study combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques — particularly Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging — using a BiLSTM-CRF model architecture.

All text annotations were performed using Label Studio, enabling precise labeling for entities such as disease names, symptoms, and transmission-related terms.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To build a structured dataset of annotated infectious disease texts.
- To implement and evaluate a BiLSTM-CRF model for NER and POS tagging.
- To improve data extraction and text understanding for health-related applications.
